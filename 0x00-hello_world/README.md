# C Programming - Project 0x00: Hello, World

Welcome to the C Programming Project 0x00! This project is the starting point of your journey in C programming. In this project, you will learn the basics of the C programming language and how to create and compile your first C program.

## Description

The C Programming Project 0x00 is designed to introduce you to the fundamentals of the C programming language. It covers the following topics:

- Setting up the development environment
- Writing a simple "Hello, World" program
- Compiling and running C programs
- Understanding basic syntax and data types in C
- Using standard input and output functions
- Introduction to variables and control flow statements

By completing this project, you will gain a solid foundation in C programming and be ready to tackle more advanced topics and projects in the future.

## Getting Started

To get started with Project 0x00, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone`.
2. Navigate to the `0x00-hello_world` directory.
3. Read the project's README file to understand the objectives and requirements.
4. Write your C program in the `main.c` file.
5. Compile your program using a C compiler such as `gcc`.
6. Run the compiled executable to see the output of your program.

## Prerequisites

Before starting Project 0x00, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- A C compiler such as `gcc` installed on your machine.
- Basic knowledge of a programming language (preferably C-like languages).
- Familiarity with the command line interface and terminal.

## Usage

To compile and run your C program, use the following commands:

```bash
gcc main.c -o hello
./hello
```

Make sure to replace `main.c` with the actual name of your C source file.
