# Simple Shell Project

Welcome to the Simple Shell project! This is a basic command-line interpreter implemented in C, designed to understand and execute simple shell commands. The project aims to showcase the fundamental concepts of process creation, program execution, and basic command parsing.

## Introduction

The Simple Shell is a small-scale emulation of a command-line interface, similar to the Unix shell. It provides a user-friendly way to interact with your operating system through text commands.

## Features

- Basic execution of commands (external programs, built-ins)
- Input and output redirection (coming soon)
- Pipelines (coming soon)
- Environment variable management
- Basic error handling

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the Simple Shell up and running on your system:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine using:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/simple-shell.git
Compile: Navigate to the project directory and compile the source code using:

sh
gcc -o shell simple_shell.c
Run: Run the compiled shell executable:

sh
./shell
Usage
Once the shell is running, you can start entering commands just like in a
regular shell. Some basic examples:

sh
$ ls -l
$ echo Hello, world!
$ env
$ exit
Functions and Examples
Here are some of the key functions implemented in the Simple Shell, along with
examples and layman explanations:

write: Prints output and prompts to the user.
read: Accepts user input.
fork: Creates a new process for executing commands.
execve: Executes commands and programs.
wait: Waits for child processes to complete.
exit: Terminates the shell.
access: Checks if a cmd is executable.
chdir: Implements the cd command.
stat: Handles file and directory information.
malloc and free: Manages memory for data structures.
For more detailed explanations and examples, please check the Functions and
Examples section in this README.
